NOW: Carefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best
revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features,
etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more
compelling/useful, etc.

For each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and
rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along
with the git-diff style change versus the original plan shown below:

```
<contents of spec will be included by oracle>
```

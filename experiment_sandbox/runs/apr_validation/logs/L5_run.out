  REVISION ROUND 1

  Workflow:     apr-validation
  Model:        5.2 Thinking
  Include impl: false
  Output:       .apr/rounds/apr-validation/round_1.md

ℹ Starting GPT Pro Extended Reasoning review...
This may take 10-60 minutes depending on complexity.

Mock Oracle called with: --engine browser -m 5.2 Thinking --file README.md --file SPEC.md --browser-attachments never --slug apr-apr-validation-round-1 --write-output .apr/rounds/apr-validation/round_1.md --files-report --heartbeat 30 --notify --browser-thinking-time heavy -p First, read this README:

```
<contents of README will be included by oracle>
```

---

NOW: Carefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best
revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features,
etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more
compelling/useful, etc.

For each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and
rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along
with the git-diff style change versus the original plan shown below:

```
<contents of spec will be included by oracle>
```

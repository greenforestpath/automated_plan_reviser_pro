CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION PROMPT
ℹ Round 1 (4.0K) for workflow 'apr-validation'

Copy the following prompt to Claude Code:

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully
and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode
to fully understand the code and technical architecture of the project.
Read ALL of the specification document at: SPEC.md

Now integrate the following feedback from GPT Pro 5.2 Extended Reasoning
(Round 1 of the APR iterative refinement process). For each
suggestion, carefully evaluate whether you agree with the proposed change.
Then apply the changes you endorse to the specification document.

Be meticulous and use ultrathink.

NOW: Carefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best
revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features,
etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more
compelling/useful, etc.

For each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and
rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along
with the git-diff style change versus the original plan shown below:

```
<contents of spec will be included by oracle>
```
